## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. Each of the katas are in their own
directory. You `cd` into the project and run `rake spec` to show the failing tests, then
complete the code to make the tests pass. Each project has the
instructions in its own _README.md_ file.

If you don't have Rspec installed yet. `gem i rspec`.

For example, to get started on the _alphabet-cipher_ kata first.

1. Clone or Fork this repo
2. cd `alphabet_cipher`
3. run `rake spec`
4. Check out the alphabet cipher instructions in the _README.md_.
5. Add the code in the source files to make the tests pass.
